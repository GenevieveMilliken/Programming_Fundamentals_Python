# Programming Fundamentals with Python
Workshop Materials for Programming Fundamentals with Python - [METRO Library Council](https://metro.org/) - 2020.03.25

This beginner-level class will address concepts foundational to all programming languages and provide an introduction to coding more generally using Python as its framework for learning. The class will begin with a brief discussion about how why Python is useful is used on the web and how it can be implemented into your workflow., then Weâ€™ll spend the remainder of the class using Python to learn about programming basics and best practices.

By the end of class, learners will be exposed to:

* Basic Syntax
* Data Types
* Variables
* Functions
* Arguments
* Logical Operations and Conditional Statements
* For Loops
* Python Libraries

Learners are not expected to have significant previous coding experience prior to attending. We will be using Jupyter Notebook and the open-source Anaconda Distribution. Please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (which comes with Jupyter Notebook) prior to the workshop.
