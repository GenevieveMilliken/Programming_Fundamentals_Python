# Programming Fundamentals with Python
Workshop Materials for Programming Fundamentals with Python - [METRO Library Council](https://metro.org/) - 2020.03.25

This beginner-level class will address concepts foundational to all programming languages and provide an introduction to coding more generally using Python as its framework for learning. The class will begin with a brief discussion about how why Python is useful is used on the web and how it can be implemented into your workflow., then We’ll spend the remainder of the class using Python to learn about programming basics and best practices.

By the end of class, learners will be exposed to:

* Basic Syntax
* Data Types
* Variables
* Functions
* Arguments
* Logical Operations and Conditional Statements
* For Loops
* Python Libraries

Learners are not expected to have significant previous coding experience prior to attending. We will be using Jupyter Notebook and the open-source Anaconda Distribution. Please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (which comes with Jupyter Notebook) prior to the workshop.

# Anaconda Installation

## MacOS

## Windows

## Linux 

In your browser, download the [Anaconda installer for Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux) (Python 3.7 version).

After fully downloaded (it may take a few minutes), enter the following to install Anaconda for Python 3.7:

`bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`

Scroll to the bottom of the license terms and enter “Yes” to agree.

The installer prompts “Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?” Enter “yes” again.

Close and open your terminal window for the installation to take effect, or you can enter the command source

`~/.bashrc`

To run conda from anywhere without having the base environment activated by default, use:

`conda init`

`conda config --set auto_activate_base False`

Launch Anaconda Navigator 

`$ source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate root`

`$ anaconda-navigator`
