    "Python is an incredibly efficient programming language and allows us to do some impressive things with only a few lines of code! Thanks to Python’s syntax, we can write “clean” code that is easier to debug and allows for overall readability. Further, Python is easily extendable and reusable, allowing you and others to build upon existing code. Python is used in a variety of contexts from game design to data analysis. It is also used a lot in academic research, especially in the sciences. It has utility regardless what discipline you come from or are currently working in."
